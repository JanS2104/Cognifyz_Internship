        One Direction, often shortened to 1D, were an English-Irish pop boy band formed in London in 2010. The group
        consisted of Niall Horan, Zayn Malik (until his departure in 2015), Liam Payne (died in 2024), Harry Styles and
        Louis Tomlinson. They became one of the best-selling boy groups of all time before going on an indefinite hiatus
        in 2016.

        The group signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and placing third in the seventh
        series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to global success by social
        media, One Direction's five albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013),
        Four (2014) and Made in the A.M. (2015), topped charts in several countries and generated hit singles including
        "What Makes You Beautiful", "Live While We're Young", "Best Song Ever", "Story of My Life" and "Drag Me Down".
        Midnight Memories was the best-selling album worldwide of 2013. With the release of Four, One Direction
        became the first band to have their first four albums debut at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.

            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <h2>2010–2011: The X Factor</h2>


            One Direction on The X Factor Live tour in 2011
            Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson auditioned as solo candidates for the
            2010 series of the British singing competition The X Factor.[19] They all failed to progress in the "Boys"
            category at the bootcamp stage of the competition, but were instead put together to form a five-piece boy
            band,[20] thus qualifying for the "Groups" category. American singer Nicole Scherzinger, a guest
            judge,[19][21][22] and long-time judge Simon Cowell both claimed to have come up with the idea of forming
            the band. In 2013, Cowell said that it "took [him] 10 minutes to put them together as a group".[23] In 2022,
            a never-before-seen video proved that Scherzinger did indeed play the most significant role in forming the
            band.[24] The video revealed Horan being chosen as the band's first member, followed by Styles, Tomlinson,
            Payne, and Malik.<img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="oned"> The band got together for two weeks to get to know
            each other and rehearse.[26][27]
            Styles came up with the band's name.[26] For their qualifying song at "judges' houses", and their first song
            as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of "Torn".[28] Cowell later commented that their
            performance convinced him that they "were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as
            well".[29] Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were his final act in the competition. The
            group quickly gained popularity in the UK.


            One Direction were the last contestant eliminated in the competition and immediately after the final, their
            song "Forever Young", which would have been released if they had won The X Factor, was leaked onto the
            internet.[30] Shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported
            £2 million Syco Records record contract.[31] Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they
            flew to Los Angeles to work with RedOne, a record producer.[32] A book licensed by One Direction, One
            Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), was published by HarperCollins in February 2011,[33]
            subsequently topping The Sunday Times Best Seller list.[34] The same month, the boy band and other
            contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. During the tour, the group performed for
            500,000 people throughout the UK.[35] After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on
            their debut album.[32] Recording took place in Stockholm, London and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked
            with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, and Rami Yacoub, among others.

            <h2>2011–2012: Up All Night</h2>
            Released in September 2011 in the UK and Ireland, One Direction's debut single, "What Makes You Beautiful",
            was a commercial and international success. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart after becoming the
            most pre-ordered Sony Music Entertainment single in history.[38][39] Subsequent singles, "Gotta Be You" and
            "One Thing", peaked in the UK Singles Chart top ten.[40][41] In November 2011, One Direction signed a record
            deal with Columbia Records in North America.[42] Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it
            was not a difficult decision to sign the band: "I just thought there was a void, and maybe they could seize
            and hold it."[43] That same month, they released Up All Night, their debut studio album, in the UK and
            Ireland. Critically commended for its appeal to the teenage audience,[44][45][46] it became the UK's
            fastest-selling debut album of 2011.[47] In December 2011, they embarked on their first headlining UK
            concert tour, the Up All Night Tour.[48]
            <br><br>
            <img class="img3" src="images/img2.jpg" alt="oned">
            Upon One Direction's arrival in the US in February 2012, the group embarked on a radio promotion spree, as
            well as their first North American concert tour as an opening act for Big Time Rush, opening 16 shows after
            they had completed the first leg of the Up All Night Tour.[49][50] That month, they announced that an
            Oceania leg had been added to the tour.[51] They made their first US television appearance on The Today
            Show, at the Rockefeller Center; an estimated 15,000 fans descended on the plaza.[52] "What Makes You
            Beautiful" was officially released in the United States that same month,[53] where it debuted on the
            Billboard Hot 100 at number 28, becoming the highest debut for a British act in more than a decade,[54] and
            ultimately reached number four. By June 2016, it would sell 4.8 million copies in the US[55] and over 7
            million copies worldwide.[56] Up All Night was released internationally in March, and One Direction became
            the first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the US,[57] and were inducted into the
            Guinness World Records as a result.[58] After the album's international release, it topped the charts in 16
            countries.[59] Up All Night also became the first album by a boy band to sell 500,000 digital copies in the
            US and, by August 2012, had sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[60][61] It was the third best-selling
            album in the world that year, selling 4.5 million copies.[62] A headlining North American leg of the tour
            was announced later that month.

            <h2>2012–2013: Take Me Home</h2>
            <img class="img3" src="images/img3.jpg" alt="oned">
            In September 2012, "Live While We're Young", the lead single from the group's second album, was released,
            and was a global success. It reached the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the
            highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist in the US.[79] A second single, "Little
            Things", resulted in the band's second number one single in the UK.[80] In November 2012, One Direction's
            second studio album, Take Me Home, was released.[81] Take Me Home sold 540,000 copies in its first week in
            the US, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and topped the charts in more than thirty-four other
            countries.[82][83] Additionally, Up All Night and Take Me Home were the number three and number four
            best-selling albums of 2012 globally, each album selling over 4.4 million units worldwide.[84] Upon reaching
            number one on the Billboard 200, the group became the first boy band in US chart history to record two
            number-one albums in the same calendar year alongside becoming the first group since 2008 to record two
            number-one albums in the same year.[85] One Direction became the first group ever to have their first two
            albums reach atop the Billboard 200.[86] The album and "Little Things" both debuted at number one in the UK
            simultaneously, making One Direction the youngest act in British chart history to achieve that.[87]
            <br><br>
            Take Me Home was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Savan
            Kotecha, Rami Yacoub, and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction's hits "What Makes You Beautiful" and "One
            Thing", spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album, and were able to shape melodies around
            their tones.[88] One Direction began recording the album in May 2012, in Stockholm at Kinglet
            Studios.[89][90][91] The album cover artwork features the group surrounding a traditional British K2 red
            telephone box, a familiar sight on the streets of the UK.[92] Take Me Home garnered generally favourable
            reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production although it was criticised for
            its generic, rushed nature.
